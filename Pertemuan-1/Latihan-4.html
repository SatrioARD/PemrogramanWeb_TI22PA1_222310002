            <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages 
                to Learn in 2022</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">There's no question that software programming is a hot career right now.
               The <strong> U.S.Bureau of Labor Statistics</strong> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 
               2018 to 2028, which is more than four times the average for all occupations. What’s 
               more, the median annual pay for a software programmer is about $106,000, which 
               is nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. workers</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, 
                and types of software require knowing and understanding different 
                programming languages—and it’s often beneficial to know multiple 
                languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming can be a 
                daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming 
                experience</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The<a href="atom.png"> Master of Science in Computer Science Align program </a>at Northeastern 
                University is specifically designed for students who want to transition into 
                computer science from another field of study.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><q><i>Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds 
                and have them come out as software engineers,</q></i> says Ian Gorton, PhD and 
                22
                director of the graduate computer science programs at Northeastern 
                University—Seattle. <q><i>We focus on math, programming, and a variety of
                computer science and engineering concepts.</q></i></p>
            <p style="text-align: right;">Whatever you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it 
                helps to know which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most 
                popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings 
                listed on job search sites Indeed, the average annual salary for those jobs, and 
                factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.</p>
